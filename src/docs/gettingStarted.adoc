== Getting Started

1. Add the following dependency:
.build.gradle
----
compile "org.grails.plugins:command:1.0.0"
----

2. Run grails create-command:
----
grails create-command <package>.<commandName>
----

or for the default package
----
grails create-command <commandName>
----

3. If this is the first command you've created, refresh the Gradle build. This will add the command
folder to the source set. You can manually add the folder to the source set by right clicking on the folder,
selecting "Mark Directory as", and selecting "Sources Root". In a future release I'll look for a better way to
automate, and eliminate this step.
